# Script : ROBLOX STUDIO 
Let's upload to Roblox Studio our vase. <br>
We need to create a MeshPart and then import the .OBJ file. <br>
(Don't forget to tick the "DoubleSided" property) <br>
Done!

Let's add the color.
We need the flower but let's put the water before.

<br>
<br>
Done!
I created a part and I put a snow blue part with a transparency of 0.4. <br>
Now, we need the script, it is available in the "Vase.lua" file. <br>
We need a ClickDetector.

<br>
Lastly, we need the flower, I will use plants for it. <br>
The plants that I have are a model so I will make them disappear with putting them in ReplicatedStorage when the water is transparent.
